# ============================================================================
# RESTORE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# This config file is meant to be used with restore.sh from a Live USB.
# Place it in the same directory as restore.sh or on the backup HDD.
#
# Unlike backup configs, this does NOT go in ~/.backup/ since restore.sh
# runs from a bootable USB before the system is installed.
# ============================================================================

# Backup source location
backup:
  # Where the backup HDD is mounted
  hdd_mount: /mnt/backup
  
  # Root directory of backups on the HDD
  backup_root: /mnt/backup/backups

# Restoration target (for --full-disk mode only)
restore:
  # Target disk to restore TO (will be COMPLETELY ERASED in full-disk mode)
  # Examples: /dev/sda, /dev/sdb
  # ⚠️ DANGER: Make sure this is the correct disk!
  target_disk: /dev/sda

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# FULL-DISK MODE (--full-disk):
#   - Uses restore.target_disk to erase and partition
#   - Creates: EFI (210MB) + Boot (2GB) + LUKS (rest)
#   - All data on target disk will be destroyed
#
# PARTITION MODE (--partitions):
#   - Ignores restore.target_disk
#   - Prompts interactively for partition selection
#   - Preserves EFI partition (Windows Boot Manager)
#   - Only formats /boot and LUKS partitions
#
